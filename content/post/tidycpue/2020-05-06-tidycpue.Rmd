My first CPUE standardization code was several hundred lines long. By hand, I fit individual glm models with different combinations of predictor variables, laboriously checking the AIC values of each added step and starting a new chunk of tested models based on the best one. I knew even then that some of this work could have been automated using something like MuMIn::dredge(), but that did not inspect the order of predictors added and interaction terms, among other things.

From here at `rstudio::conf(2020)` where I'm happy to be attending as a Diversity Scholar, I whipped up a tidyverse solution to these qualms. Max Kuhn et al have extensive dox explaining how this very basic (i.e. fixed effects) framework can be re-framed into a mixed-effects or stan setup. The code below is effectively a tenth of what I did before, and automates the checking of many models specified via fit_with using or ignoring interactive terms. At the end I use purrr::map to calculate AIC on all at once, extract and plot outputs. I load a few packages up top but really you could do this with fewer if you plotted in base and had your own AIC function.

If you look into the cpue_fits object, you get a neat summary of every model specified, no for-loops required

Disclaimer: this data is totally fake, and the point here isn't whether or not the model makes the most sense from a CPUE standpoint. I fudged it a bit so the CPUE actually tracks fairly well with catch.
