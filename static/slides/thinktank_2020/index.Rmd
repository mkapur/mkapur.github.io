# Outline
.inverse[Ground Floor OR the 30,000 foot view]
+ Why a transboundary, spatial OM for Sablefish?
+ Basic model structure
+ Preliminary results & where this is headed

+ Discuss as we go (interrupt me  `r emo::ji("smile")`)

???
Don't forget that it is easy to add n selex curves, harder to change the array structure

group came together in 2018
this couples with some anecdotes (recruitment) led us to examine
where there may be a mismatch in the actual demography of sab, and our managemetn framework
and more importantly what effects those choices have on resultant management estimates

- study enabled by strong basis of extant work examining the mismatch between spp and assessment structure
- figure from AEP paper but there are many for generalized or specific fisheries
- what was done is build spatially explicity OM and assess using frameworks which either ignore or acct for 
- sptl structure w varying degree of accuracy (panels)
- takeaway here, corroborated elsewhere, is that if you ignore space completely you get bias garanz (top rows)
- also spatial models typically less precise (sample size, npar)
- ALSO there are intermediate approximations which perform decently

- this means we are fairly confident that our impost assessment framework is introducing bias in SAB
- no need to write the post about that
- question arises about the feedback, or interplay, between the degree of bias and our control rules
- used to determine catch.
- to date most work fixes a level of F either a sub-area or system wide scale and investigates depl

# Ground Floor

+ OM is run in `R` 
+ Conditioning/estimation happens in `TMB` 
+ We are `not` shooting to replicate Stock Synthesis (etc.) exactly in structure nor estimated quantities 


???
For example, R scripts pre-process the data, but TMB code uses that data to produce an expected Numbers-at-age matrix, estimate parameters, etc, then pass back to R for plotting

gives rise to the 6 modeled areas in our OM

The last thing I want to add is about survey fleets; those involved with my sptl temporal std work know that i developed a novel index usting VAST. this means that i actually have unique "survey fleets" for each region which are composites

## What comes out of the OM?

Time series of...
+ Surveyed abundance, by fleet
+ Age & Length compositions, by fleet (where applicable)
+ Catch & discards
+ Numbers-at-age/length
+ Biomass 
+ Tuned values e.g. $F$, selectivity, $R_0$

# OM Data Generation
.inverse[How do we know if we've done a good job?]
+ The model fits the input data fairly well
+ Our notion of population productivity and exploitation through time doesn't change much *at the management level*

--
.inverse[What can we learn?]
+ Perhaps compensation is occuring in a given direction (ie due to movement)
+ Perhaps we are obtaining an innacurate picture of the population by assessing it separately



???
On the "reproduce" point, I am not positive how well matched it will be dependong on movement outcomes
I can certainly see place for a validation step w movement off

In the dynamics section, when I walk thru equations I will include standout likelihood issues/estimation questions
