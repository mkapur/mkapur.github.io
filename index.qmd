I am a federal Research Mathematical Statistician at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (NOAA, Seattle). I received my PhD from the the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Science at the University of Washington in the [Punt Lab](http://puntlab.washington.edu/maia-kapur/). My research was supported by a [NMFS-Sea Grant Population Dynamics Fellowship](https://seagrant.noaa.gov/News/Article/ArtMID/1660/ArticleID/2750/NOAA-Sea-Grant-and-Fisheries-announce-2019-Ecosystem-and-Population-Dynamics-Fellows) awarded in 2019.

Previously I worked as an Assessment Specialist at the Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research at PIFSC (NOAA) in Honolulu and completed my MSc at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology. I have also worked in the Florida Keys and studied at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Bocas Del Toro, Panama while completing my BSc in Environmental Science at UC Berkeley.

My current research interests include: how evolution and ecology conspire to bias survey data; how to incorporate spatial heterogeniety into the assessment process; and the reliability of commonly-used model diagnostics.
