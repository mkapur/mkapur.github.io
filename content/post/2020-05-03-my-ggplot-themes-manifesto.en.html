<p>A few months ago I tweeted about the value of creating custom ggplot2 themes for easily synchronizing the look of all your figs for a given talk or manuscript. Some folks take this to another level and effectively have a personal aesthetic (see what I did there) that they use across their work, which I find compelling. I am obviously not a graphic designer, but I love beautiful plots, and wanted to consolidate some of the best resources + starter tips for others here. These range from out-of-the-box default themes within the ggplot2 package itself, to those made by others, to resources you can use to make your own more (or less) from scratch.</p>
<div id="straight-up-ggplot" class="section level1">
<h1>1 Straight up ggplot()</h1>
<p>This is the ggplot2 default. Can we just agree that the grey background with nursery colors is not cute? I think Hadley did this on purpose to encourage us to find alternatives.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, fill = Species)) + geom_boxplot()</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/ggthemes/notheme.png" />

</div>
</div>
