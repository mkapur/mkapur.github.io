<p>I haven’t written much about career topics since porting my blog here, but have been dealing with a case of FOMO/what-if? syndrome for the last month or so and wanted to put down some thoughts here.
It has been my observation that folks in academia, like other professions that require lots of up-front investment, draw a ton of their identity from their work. This means that getting to work, meaning the job one holds at the end of one’s training, becomes a huge player in their sense of self-worth. Lives are built upon finding the job that we believe we have trained for. Egos get crushed if that one job doesn’t play out in the timeline we’d hoped it would. Relationships get strained or dissolve when both partners aren’t able to find the perfect fit in the same time and place. I’m not here to comment on whether that is a good thing or not. Rather, I think it’s worth remembering what a job is.</p>
<p>It’s firstly a means to meet your material needs. A roof, food, utilities, and hopefully some extra for your future and those who depend upon you.</p>
<p>It might be a means to meet your emotional needs, like your need to be close to a family or a partner, or to live in a place that you feel bonded with.</p>
<p>It might be a means to meet your intellectual needs, like using the training you spent your youth acquiring, or to contribute to a field or solution you feel strongly about.</p>
<p>Sadly, most folks in academia get the tunnel-vision that comes with only hanging out with other folks in academia – that is, they forget that for the overwhelming majority of humankind and human history, a job satisfies only the first point above: a means to survive. It’s not glorious. Seeing our parents exists in jobs that only meet our needs are the reason many of us pursued higher education in the first place. But, the “secret” those job-holders have is that their identity is not nearly so tied up in their work. Perhaps they enjoy some parts of their work; almost invariably, they do it well (since it’s easier to lose a job in more precarious sectors). But their self-perception as someone whose life has been worthwhile has very little to do with what happens at their workplace. Think about that – how frequently have you read about someone else’s accomplishments and thought, “wow, I’m totally behind” or “Maybe my project isn’t even worth it” or “maybe I shouldn’t even be in [research/grad school]?” How often do you get paralyzed by self-doubt, unable to make headway on your coursework or dissertation, because you aren’t sure you will ultimately make it in the super-tight job market you’ve learned is only more impossible every year? Unless you’re enormously resilient and self-aware, I’m guessing this happens to you at least a few times a year.</p>
