# Research Questions

## Sablefish Specific

+ What is the current spatial structure of sablefish demography (namely growth) across the NE Pacific?

--

+ Can a spatially-explicit, range-wide operating model produce similar population dynamics as suggested by the current regional assessments? 

--

+ If not, how distinct are the dynamics produced by such an operating model? 


???
these are sab specific, but same types of questions being asked by many stocks

- study enabled by strong basis of extant work examining the mismatch between spp and assessment structure
- figure from AEP paper but there are many for generalized or specific fisheries
- what was done is build spatially explicity OM and assess using frameworks which either ignore or acct for 
- sptl structure w varying degree of accuracy (panels)
- takeaway here, corroborated elsewhere, is that if you ignore space completely you get bias garanz (top rows)
- also spatial models typically less precise (sample size, npar)
- ALSO there are intermediate approximations which perform decently

- this means we are fairly confident that our impost assessment framework is introducing bias in SAB
- no need to write the post about that
- question arises about the feedback, or interplay, between the degree of bias and our control rules
- used to determine catch.
- to date most work fixes a level of F either a sub-area or system wide scale and investigates depl

## Broader

+ What happens to estimated quantities when spatial structure diverges from reality?

will show slide later with actual questions but whant to acknolwege
that this is using sab as case study and aims to encompass tradeoffs between 
spatial strucutre at both the operational and estimation levels, as well as evaluate performance of various

you might ask why go thru this and not just model rec at i
the reason is want to be faithful to the notion of stock as demographic engine
if you're blind to the ecology, could also state that we are inducing spatial

-final one is most interesting to me and that is sptl structure 
-om is 2 areas, with movement from one to another
-EM misspec assesses all as 1
-this is a rich and active area of research in IPMs & fisheries assessment
-we know that getting space wrong can be fairly detrimental to density dependence and other things

- also looked at the same thing but space last
- the reason we did it this way is two fold; wanted to avoid going in and changing the spatial structure of the model multiple times
- also were interested in the precedence of this feautre which is so widely studied.
for example E2 allows us to ask, if you got everything else right, is it really so great to get space done?

- the more interesting question is: what is the identity of those misspecs that give us the most bang for our buck?
- this plot is averaged across OMs etc and shows the abs relative error... etc
- the x axis has the # of misspecs aka the panels on previous
- and the colors are the amt of relative error for the last 10 years SSB
- the labels tell you what is misspecified in the model
- the more yellow, the better
- what we see here is that going from 5 to 4 misspecs has an outsize pos effect on rel err,
- which is interesting because in every single case that was where we fixed spatial structure
- improvements continue after that, but the biggest decline happens at that initial step
- this result is especially striking, because...

- the exact same was found for exp 2, where spatial structure wasn't corrected until after all else
- this plot is setup the same way, with the labeled letters tellin you what's wrong with this model
- as we expect, we do see the model getting more oand more correct with fewer misspecs, but we never get into the "yellow zone" until space is cleared up.

- Another interesting thing we can see from this plot is what besides space seems to have a possitive effect
- on the left side of this image we are looking at models with only one or two correctiongs
- say we were only interested in correcting one thing, moving from 5 to 4 misspecs,
- we see these clusters of lighter areas that seem to have done better
- what they have in common is these were EMs which corrected L (asymp length) or X (selex)

- can show these results from the previousin the format i introduced at the beginning, 
- where we see the spread of absolute changes in relErr accodring to identity.
- here i have two panels now, the right hand is biomass which is the same as the plot we saw before
- and right is recruitment
- What is cool is that for this experiment, space wasn't corrected till the very end but STILL had the largest impact on relative error 
- NOTE TO SELF: the variation comes from the fact that we're compiling any poss location where X,L etc were corrected, hence the spread. interesting that the trend persists even though there were equivalent # of models which were run with L last etc

- one other interesting result to share
- here is E1 again but for recruitment
- as I'd expect, mag/var in rel err goes way up as we increase number of misspecs
- some of this is due to div small numbers, but still
- weirdest thing was this strange banding, which suggests 
- that there are clusters of EMs which are mostly pos or neg biased
- so i took this plot, and re-colored it...

- to illustrate what value of natural mortality was used within the EMs
- here, blue means the EM was misspecified using a natM above than the OM, and gold was below
- we only start to see white lines up to number 3, because models with 4 or 5 misspecs for E1 only have space misspeced
- the outcome here is that only those models with M and SPACE right are hanging out around the zero line,
- and we can effectively predict the direction of bias in your recruit estimates depending on whether natM is low or hi

- there were also interesting sub-findings of this work
- which was that even if you started with correct spatial structure,
- having misspec M will guarantee that your model outputs are biased,
- and we can even predict the direction depending whether M is hi or low.

- finally exp 2 revaled that while space is most important, the quickest reduction in
- relerr for biomass otherwise came from correcting growth and selex early on.
- so some of your prioritization among these things would depend on if you were more interested in SSB and recruitment

# Initial Conditions
The model is initialized with A years (denoted “init”) of movement, recruitment deviations, and without fishing.
$N^i_{init,\gamma,a} =  \begin{cases} 0.5\omega^i_a \tau^{ik}R^k_0  exp(-\sum_a M_a^k)  \times exp(-0.5 \sigma^2_R + \tilde R^k_{init-1}) & \text{if } a < A\\ \omega^i_a\frac{N^i_{init-1,\gamma,A-1}exp(-\sum_a M_a^k)}{1-exp(-M_a^k)}\times exp(-0.5 \sigma^2_R + \tilde R^k_{init-1})              & \text{a = A}\end{cases}$

+ $\omega$ is the eigenvector of $X^ij_a$, the movement matrix
+ $\tau$ is the user-defined down-scaling of recruitment at stock level $k$ to sub-area $i$

# Equilibrium Numbers
Calculate unfished age distribution at the stock level and partition into sub-areas:

$N^i_{0,\gamma,a} =  \begin{cases} 0.5\omega^i_a \tau^{ik} exp(\epsilon _{\tau_{ik}}-\sum_a M_a^k)  & \text{if } a < A\\\omega^i_a\frac{N^i_{\gamma,A-1}exp(-\sum_a M_a^k)}{1-exp(-M_a^k)}  & \text{a = A}\end{cases}$
+ $\omega$ is the eigenvector of $X^{ij}_a$, the movement matrix
+ $\tau$ is the user-defined down-scaling of recruitment at stock level $k$ to sub-area $i$
+ $\epsilon _{\tau_{ik}}$ is an error term on $\tau$

# Order of Operations
.small[
The general workflow of the operating model is as follows:
+ 1)	Read input data, including observed retained and discarded catches, survey indices, age and length compositions
+ 2)	Establish initial values for all parameters listed in Table 3; perform transformations where applicable.
+ 3)	Run model for A years with recruitment deviates, but without fishing mortality  .
+ 4)	Loop over modeled years from 1970-2018. For each year, make calculations and generated data in the following order: <Br>
    a.	Tune F, Z and selectivity given the captures taken in this year
    b.	Update numbers-at-age matrices, and biomass in each sub-area
    c.	Move fish among stocks via X
    d.	Undergo growth
    e.	Invoke system-wide recruitment following end-of-year SSB
    f.	Conduct  survey sampling (midyear) 
    g.	Compute expected values for all data types (note predicted catches, survey observations subject to error)
+ 6)	Contribute to respective likelihood functions 
+ 7)	Calculate and store reference points and other monitored quantities.
+ 8)	 Calculate quantities at equilibrium (no fishing).
