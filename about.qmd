I am currently both a federal Research Mathematical Statistician at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (NOAA, Seattle) and a PhD Candidate at the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Science at the University of Washington in the [Punt Lab](http://puntlab.washington.edu/maia-kapur/). My research was supported by a [NMFS-Sea Grant Population Dynamics Fellowship](https://seagrant.noaa.gov/News/Article/ArtMID/1660/ArticleID/2750/NOAA-Sea-Grant-and-Fisheries-announce-2019-Ecosystem-and-Population-Dynamics-Fellows) awarded in 2019. Previously I worked as an Assessment Specialist at the Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research at PIFSC (NOAA) in Honolulu and completed my MSc at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology. I have also worked in the Florida Keys and studied at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Bocas Del Toro, Panama while completing my BSc in Environmental Science at UC Berkeley.
