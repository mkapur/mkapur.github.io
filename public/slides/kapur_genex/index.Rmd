# Motiviation II: Science

.pull-left[
+ A fair bit has been done on spatial mis-match vs. estimation uncertainty.

+ Lesser work on how spatial misspecification flows into HCR performance

]
???

explain what we do know -- summarize major research

# Research Questions

## Sablefish Specific

+ What is the current spatial structure of sablefish demography (namely growth) across the NE Pacific?

--

+ Can a spatially-explicit, range-wide operating model produce similar population dynamics as suggested by the current regional assessments? 

--

+ If not, how distinct are the dynamics produced by such an operating model? 

---
# Research Questions

## Broader

+ What happens to estimated quantities when spatial structure diverges from reality?

--

+ Are there combinations of HCRs/Spatial assessment frameworks which *reduce reduce undesirable outcomes for the sablefish fishery or population*?

+ Simple question, not-so-easy to answer

---
## Chapter 1: Spatial Growth Variation
### A method to detect spatio-(temporal) breakpoints

+ “Let the data talk”

+ Fit a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to a single age and sex

+ Smoothers for year, latitude, and longitude

+ Evaluate 1st derivative of each smoother to see where it is changing most

## Chapter 1: Spatial Growth Variation
need BLACK map of new breaks 
???
transpose me onto a map

---
## Chapter 1: Spatial Growth Variation
BLACK map of growth estimates
---
## Chapter 1: Spatial Growth Variation
maturity and movement, if available

---
## Chapter 2: An Operating Model for NE Pacific Sablefish
+ How is the model structured?
+ What are the key assumptions?
---
## Chapter 2: An Operating Model for NE Pacific Sablefish
breakpoints map, add labels
consider doing "buildup" of model structure as in OM talk

---
## Chapter 3: Management Strategy Evaluation
+ Revisit the questions
+ What we need to do this

---
## Chapter 4: Sneaking up on a well-specified model
insert slides from quantsem


---
# My Contribution
+ Is the current sab management paradigm performing worse than transboundary management could?
+ Are there key processes that dictate that answer?
+ Another nail in the space-rules coffin
