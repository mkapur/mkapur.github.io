Adjusting for bias due to variability of estimated recruitments in fishery assessment models. Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 68, 1744–1760. https://doi.org/10.1139/f2011-092.\nHere I want to jot down the practical implementation behind the recruitment deviate for those working in Stock Synthesis or building their own models from scratch. The main topics to discuss are 1) The meaning of a recruitment deviate (abbreviated here to “rec-dev”), 2) how it plays in your dynamics equations, and 3) keeping an eye out for lognormal bias correction.\nWhat is a rec-dev?\rA recruitment deviate is how much a given year’s recruitment deviates from what you’d expect given a stock-recruit relationship (in this post I’ll use the Beverton-Holt as an example). The idea is that there could be many reasons for a stock to produce a number of recruits which is different from the deterministic value defined by the current stock size (among other parameters). Reasons for this deviation could be environmental, and are generally unexplained – which is why the time series of rec devs is often interpreted as process error in your system (all the extra natural noise our model can’t capture).\nLet’s quickly refresh what we’re talking about when we say the “mean” or expected recruitment level. Again, using the Bev-Holt as an example:\n\\[ R_{expected} = \\frac{SSB 4hR_0}{SSB_0(1-h)+ SSB(5h-1)} \\]\n\\(h\\) is steepness, or the expected proportion of \\(R_0\\) anticipated at \\(0.2SSB_0\\); \\(R_0\\) and \\(SSB_0\\) are virgin recruitment and spawning biomass, respectively.\nIf we make up some numbers for these parameters and plug them in, the resultant relationship might look something like this:\nCool. Now let’s consider that we have some notion of error around this deterministic value; this error could arise from uncertainty in the parameters of the stock recruit curve. Here, the shaded zone is the 95% confidence interval around our expected recruitment. 95% of recruitment values in a given year at a given SB should fall within that zone.\nGiven this error, your observed recruitment in a given year may deviate from the black curve somewhat. The new observed recruitments are shown as gold points; the line separating each point from the expected value is the raw value of the deviate itself.\nLet’s think for a second. If we deal in absolutes, the raw (absolute) value of a deviate at high biomass is going to be much larger than the deviate at low biomass. This isn’t very helpful if we’re trying to quantify the degree to which our stock’s recruitment in year \\(y\\) is diverging from expectation. For that reason, we are interested in modeling the errors, or deviates, as lognormally distributed. Equation-wise, here’s what that looks like. Note that \\(R_{det}\\) is simply the deterministic value of recruitment, which could come from a Bev-Holt, Ricker, you name it.\n\\[\rR_{expected,y} = R_{det,y}exp(dev_y-\\sigma^2/2)\r\\]\nNow we’ll quickly refresh the idea behind the lognormal distribution and explain what’s up with that \\(-\\sigma^2/2\\).\n\rRefreshing the lognormal distribution.\rIf our devs are normally distributed with mean zero, \\(exp(\\mu = 0)\\) is lognormally distributed, shown in blue below:\nIf \\(X ~ N(\\mu,\\theta)\\) and \\(Y = e^X\\), the expected value of \\(X\\) is \\(\\mu\\), and the expected value of \\(Y\\) will be \\(e^{\\mu+\\theta/2}\\), not \\(e^{\\mu}\\).\nNote that \\(exp(X)\\) is 1) never less than zero and 2) pretty asymmetrical. What this means mathematically is that the mean of \\(exp(X)\\) is in fact not the same as \\(exp(mean(X))\\). Confirm this for yourself by testing the following. They’ve been added to the plots above as vertical dashed lines.\nmean(X) ## should be close to 0\r## [1] -0.01505518\rexp(mean(X)) ## should be close to 1\r## [1] 0.9850576\rmean(exp(X)) ## uh-oh! It\u0026#39;s way bigger...\r## [1] 1.626412\rexp(mu+sigma/2) ##... in fact, the expected value of exp(X) is ~exp(mu+sigma/2)\r## [1] 1.648721\r\rBias correction to the rescue\rBack to the recruitment example, we can pretend that \\(X\\) here is our vector of recruitment deviates. We set the mean for \\(dev_y\\) to 0 in hopes that, on an “average” year, we’ll be multiplying \\(R_{det,y}\\) (deterministic recruitment) by \\(exp(0) = 1\\), and get the expected value back. However, because we’ve discovered that \\(exp(dev_y)\\) is not symmetrical, we need to perform a bias correction to confirm that we approximately return the deterministic value when \\(dev_y\\) is zero. In other words, we are adjusting how we back-transform the deviates to confirm that the mean of those deviates is roughly one, on a normal scale.\nCheck it out:\nexp(mean(X)) ## should be close to 1, as above\r## [1] 0.9850576\rmean(exp(X-1^2/2)) ## with bias correction, closer to 1 again!\r## [1] 0.9864687\rOne last thing. Normally we present a time series of rec-devs, and leave them in log space (to get around the scale issue I mentioned above).\nImagining we had a time series of data which encompassed all the different \\(SB\\) values corresponding to the gold points above, we could plot the deviates through time (I randomly reordered the values):\nSo now, the horizontal line at zero represents the deterministic or expected recruitment, and the points are the log deviations from that mean. Now you can interpret this plot intuitively, where values below zero were “worse than average years”, and vice versa. What’s more, because we are working in log space you can also get a quantitative sense of how divergent from expectation the recruits were in this year regardless of the stock size at hand.\n\r","date":1611532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611182187,"objectID":"d7d05057f6286e0194aa7548f8016012","permalink":"/post/recdevs/how-rec-devs/","publishdate":"2021-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/recdevs/how-rec-devs/","section":"post","summary":"For an in-depth description of the theory and math behind recruitment deviations in assessment models, check out Methot, R.D., Taylor, I.G., Chen, Y., 2011.

What is up with that?\nLet’s take the example of a basic selectivity-at-age function, which uses the parameters \\(a_{50}\\) and \\(a_{95}\\). These represent the ages where a fish has a probability 50% or 95% chance of being captured. Read that again carefully. I took these parameters for granted, but the meaning of them is intertwined with the use of \\(ln(19)\\), and if they change, so does the logged value.\nHere’s a selectivity plot with some made up numbers. The selectivity function I’m using is:\n\\[\rS_a = \\langle 1+exp(-log(19)*\\frac{a-a_{50}}{a_{95}-a_{50}}) \\rangle ^{-1}\r\\]\nNote how nicely these values extend between zero and one (on the y axis)? That’s because we’re really interested in working with the odds of being captured. Based on our parameter definitions, we need to ensure that the logistic function equals 0.95 when \\(a = a_{95}\\) (and similarly equals 0.5 at \\(a_{50}\\)). To achieve this, we recognize the exponent of the log odds equals the odds ratio. You can think of the odds ratio as the probability of your event (getting captured) happening over the probability of it not happening. We can leverage this to force the logistic equation to scale the way we want.\nSince we’ve already defined \\(a_{95}\\) as the age at which we have a 95% probability of getting captured, the log-odds can be defined as \\(log(\\frac{0.95}{0.05})\\). This could be rewritten as \\(log(\\frac{19/20}{1/20})\\) and simplifies to \\(log(19)\\). This ensures that when \\(a = a_{95}\\), the equation up top indeed returns 0.95, which is the logistic function evaluated at an odds ratio of 95%.\nGiven this syntax you’ll see how we would never really need to correct for \\(a_{50}\\), since the odds ratio of two events with 50% probability is actually zero (plug in 0.5 to see for yourself).\nTwo notes:\nSometimes to ease model fitting, we will simplify the above equation by substituting \\(\\delta\\) in place of the denominator (\\(a_{95} - a_{50}\\)), or estimate \\(\\delta\\) as \\(\\frac{ln(19)}{a_{95} - a_{50}}\\).\n\rIf you’d want to use the something like \\(a_{75}\\), you’d need to update the log odds via \\(log(\\frac{0.75}{0.25})\\) or ~ \\(log(3)\\). Note that this ensures that you are getting a 75% selectivity at the corresponding age, but provides a distinct curve from before.\n\r\r","date":1609718400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609799787,"objectID":"4b1a27a5242c017c3a66b215d35f3504","permalink":"/post/ln19/why-ln19/","publishdate":"2021-01-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ln19/why-ln19/","section":"post","summary":"Have you ever noticed that sneaky \\(log(19)\\) in your logistic equation for maturity or selectivity?

This latter point was fairly disconcerting for me, as it’s hard to know if you’re doing well on a test designed to expose your shortcomings. Also, unlike the Qualifying exam, the format is an all-in-one, three-hour oral bonanza where there is no way to scream into a paper bag take breaks/regroup after a particularly hard question. In any case, I passed, so here are some tips that can hopefully be generalizable to others taking exams in a similar format. I’ve split these into prep tips and in-the-moment advice.\nIn Preparation \rSimplify the guessing game. Studying for this exam is a little harder because your committee may not give you any readings or additional topics to read about, leaving you to think you should know the entirety of your scientific field. Rather, your #1 priority should be to demonstrate you grasp the essential concepts, assumptions and methods YOU will use in your disseration work, and have a notion of how your results will fit into the literature at large. For that reason, I spent about 85% of my time making my proposal presentation clear and thorough, and prepared for questions like “How do you expect X to play into your results?”, “Have you considered using Y method?”, and “How is this different from work by Z?”. You’ll notice these are open ended and designed to check that you aren’t just following a recipe for your study.\n\rThe 15% basis I studied on the unempirical assumption that only 15% of the committee’s confidence in my ability to complete my project would be based on my ability to respond to technical \u0026amp; conceptual questions about my field. I convinced myself that the overwhelming factor which will convince them that I’m ready to progress on my dissertation is, well, the demonstrated progress I’ve actually made to this point (writing a proposal counts, too!). In other words, the committee ~is not going to~ did not fail me because I [did] get nervous, blank out, or can’t perfectly recall a concept in the moment, if I’ve otherwise demonstrated I can produce research and find answers when I need them. However, there are some “tricks” towards approaching that 15%, which I share in point #3.\n\rThe 101 Slide \u0026amp; The “Warrants Future Research”. I recognized that the questions people fear getting – the sudden-death, “gotcha” questions regarding a specific paper/equation/idea in your field, are less terrifying if you think of them the way the faculty think of them. I find such questions invariably fall into one of two categories.\rThe first I call the “101 Slide”. These are questions about basic concepts in your field which a 101 (introductory) course may have dedicated a lecture or lab exercise to – and that is the degree of response they are looking for! A classic my adviser throws around is, “How do you get the highest fishing yield from a cohort?”. Your brain will instantly rat-wheel around all the things that could lead one to not know the maximum yield…but the answer, literally, is “fish when the cohort biomass is maximized.” Exactly the response that would appear on an undergrad lecture slide! Full disclosure: I blanked out on a 101 question fairly early in my exam and was pretty sure it was a fatal mistake. Depsite all the knowledge I had about this phenomenon, I still fell prey to the anxiety-brain-wipe…and survived. So you will, too 😄\n\r“Warrants future research” are questions likely to appear in the discussion part of (the faculty’s) recent papers, and they are not expecting you to have a definitive answer. Questions beginning with “have you thought about…” or “what is the possibility…” are hints that the topic falls into this category and they’re asking you to spectulate. When in doubt, it looks good to start mentioning extant work on that topic; the faculty may guide you towards which paper(s) they felt were conclusive, or be satisfied to know that you are aware it is an area of ongoing research. A strong response would suggest what experiments could be done to reduce speculation.\n\r\r\rThe trick, obviously, regarding point 3 is knowing which category the question falls into given the topic. You should be generally familiar with open research questions in your field, emphasizing those related directly to your project and pet interests of your faculty members. For example, my disseration doesn’t do a lot of environmental modeling explicitly, but I am aware that there is an open debate regarding the influence of climate (environment) vs biomass on determining recruitment. I can name the folks involved in this work and what their general findings have been, and some of the challenges to implementing such research in our own context.\n\rIn the Moment\rHere are some pointers – but know that nothing can calm you down come exam day like knowing you have put in the right amount of preparation.\n\rIn my adviser’s words: “Don’t be chaotic”. This means don’t panic. Repeat the question back once asked to buy yourself some time.\rAny amount of silence feels way longer to you than it does to them. It looks better to pause and choose your words carefully than to ramble and hope you step on a right-answer mine.\rDO NOT overhydrate beforehand. You will need to be abiotic for three hours.\rKeep in mind you have probably read WAY more papers in depth in the last ~2 months than the faculty. Also keep in mind that while they could readily write down important equations/concepts that they regularly work with, they really don’t know everything and likely could not perfectly answer every question asked by the others in the room if the roles were reversed. This isn’t about being arrogant, it’s about being realistic in what actually makes for a succesful scientist.\rAssume they want you to pass and move on. Failing looks bad on your advisor, ultimately – so believe that this is a group that wants to see you suceeed.\r“I don’t know” is a valid response. If you are afraid the question falls into the category of 3a (101 Slide) and you really draw a blank, you could choose to mention how you do/do not think it super relevant to your project, hence giving a bit of cover for perhaps why you didn’t review it in depth. Silence is better than rambling here.\r\r\r","date":1591228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591228800,"objectID":"3e2480c11cea66c0f13d3daf18db00f5","permalink":"/post/generals/how-studied-general/","publishdate":"2020-06-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/generals/how-studied-general/","section":"post","summary":"I am finally a PhD Candidate!

I wanted to centralize some algebra for myself and anyone else who uses this relationship regularly.\nThe Bev-Holt SRR\rLet’s start with some working definitions.\n\\[ \\begin{array} {rr}\rR_0 \\quad virgin, \\quad unfished \\quad recruitment \\\\ SBPR_0 \\quad virgin, \\quad unfished \\quad spawner \\quad biomass-per-recruit \\\\ SSB_0 \\quad virgin, \\quad unfished \\quad spawning \\quad biomass \\\\ SBPR_F \\quad \\quad biomass-per-recruit \\quad at \\quad F \\neq 0 \\\\ SSB_F \\quad spawning \\quad biomass \\quad at \\quad F \\neq 0 \\\\ YPR_F \\quad yield-per-recruit \\quad at \\quad F \\neq 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\]\nFirst, let’s illustrate how one strings these quantities together in an age-structured model assuming a stock-recruit relationship to derive equilibrium quantities.\n\rYield-per-Recruit quantities at various F\rFind \\(SBPR\\) and \\(YPR\\) at your \\(F\\) value of interest, and also calculate these values when \\(F = 0\\). This will vary slightly depending on the setup of your model, but in pseudo-math: \\(YPR = \\large \\Sigma_a \\small Fs_aN_aw_a\\), Where \\(N_a\\) is a proportional expected number-at-age, \\(w_a\\) is the expected weight-at-age, and \\(s_a\\) is fishery selectivity. \\[\rSBPR = \\large \\Sigma_a \\small E_aN_aw_a\r\\] Here \\(E_a\\) is some measure of your population’s fecundity at age. The resultant \\(SBPR\\) is going to vary with \\(F\\) because \\(N_a\\) will decline faster when \\(F\\) is greater than zero.\r\r\rSRR in terms of SBPR\r2a) Look at your stock-recruitment relationship. \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are parameters of the Beverton-Holt SRR. We also leverage the definition of equilibrium stock spawning biomass as the product of unfished SBPR and Recruitment. You can confirm this makes sense by describing the equation with words: the virgin/unfished spawning biomass is the expected spawning biomass for one virgin/unfished recruit times the number of recruits. The same relationship will apply for equilibrium biomass. You will need to pick a number (or estimate) \\(R_0\\).\n\\[ \\begin{array} {rr}\rR_F = \\frac{SSB_F}{\\alpha + \\beta SSB_F} \\quad Bev-Holt\\\\\rSSB_0 = SBPR_0 \\times R_0 \\\\\rSSB_{eq} = SBPR_{eq} \\times R_{eq} \\\\\r\\end{array} \\] 2b) Re-arrange the SRR to be in terms of \\(SBPR\\). We do this by substitution. \\[ \\begin{array}\r{rr}\rR_F = \\frac{SSB_F}{\\alpha + \\beta SSB_F} \\quad Bev-Holt\\\\\rSSB_{eq} = SBPR_{eq} \\times R_{eq} \\\\\rR_{eq} = \\frac{SBPR_{eq} \\times R_{eq} }{\\alpha + \\beta ( SBPR_{eq} \\times R_{eq} )} \\\\\rR_{eq}(\\alpha + \\beta ( SBPR_{eq} \\times R_{eq} )) = SBPR_{eq} \\times R_{eq} \\\\\r\\alpha + \\beta ( SBPR_{eq} \\times R_{eq} ) = SBPR_{eq} \\\\\r\\beta ( SBPR_{eq} \\times R_{eq} ) = SBPR_{eq} - \\alpha \\\\\rR_{eq} = \\frac{ SBPR_{eq} - \\alpha}{\\beta \\times SBPR_{eq} } \\\\\r\\end{array} \\]\nAlpha \u0026amp; Beta in terms of steepness \u0026amp; recruitment\rSweet, now we need a nice definition for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Spoiler: these only vary by \\(R_0\\) and steepness, \\(h\\), which is defined as the expected recruitment at 20% of \\(SSB_0\\) (hence the 0.2s). Here’s the derivation of those values. Recall that \\(SSB_0 = SBPR_0 \\times R_0\\), meaning \\(SBPR_0\\) can be substituted for \\(\\frac{SSB_0}{R_0}\\). Let’s start with beta:\r\r\\[\r\\begin{array}\r{cc}\rR_0 = \\frac{SSB_0}{\\alpha + \\beta SSB_0} \u0026amp; original \\\\\r\\alpha + \\beta SSB_0 = \\frac{SSB_0}{R_0} \u0026amp; rearrange, \\quad sub \\\\\r\\alpha =SBPR_0 - \\beta SSB_0 \u0026amp; alpha \\\\\rhR_0 = \\frac{0.2SSB_0}{\\alpha + 0.2 \\beta SSB_0} \u0026amp; h @ 0.2SSB_0 \\\\\rhR_0 = \\frac{0.2SSB_0}{SBPR_0 - \\beta SSB_0 + 0.2 \\beta SSB_0} \u0026amp; substitute \\\\\rhR_0 = \\frac{0.2SSB_0}{SBPR_0 - 0.8 \\beta SSB_0} \u0026amp; simplify \\\\\rhR_0SBPR_0 - 0.8hR_0\\beta SSB_0= 0.2SSB_0 \u0026amp; multiply \\quad denom\\\\\rhSSB_0 - 0.8hR_0\\beta SSB_0= 0.2SSB_0 \u0026amp; sub \\quad SSB_0 = \\tilde S R_0\\\\\rh - 0.8hR_0\\beta = 0.2 \u0026amp; div \\quad SSB_0 \\\\\r5h - 4hR_0\\beta = 1 \u0026amp; mult \\quad 5 \\\\\r\\frac{5h-1}{4hR_0} = \\beta \u0026amp; solve \\quad \\beta \\\\\r\\end{array}\r\\]\nAnd now for \\(\\alpha\\), starting at the third equation from above:\n\\[\r\\begin{array}\r{cc}\r\\alpha =SBPR_0 - \\beta SSB_0 \u0026amp; from \\quad above \\\\\r\\alpha =SBPR_0 - \\frac{5h-1}{4hR_0}SSB_0 \u0026amp; sub \\quad \\beta \\\\\r\\alpha =SBPR_0 - \\frac{5h-1}{4hR_0}SBPR_0 R_0 \u0026amp; sub \\quad SSB_0 = SBPR_0 R_0 \\\\\r\\alpha =SBPR_0 - \\frac{5h-1}{4h}SBPR_0 \u0026amp; cancel \\quad R_0 \\\\\r\\alpha =SBPR_0 \\langle1- \\frac{5h-1}{4h}\\rangle \u0026amp; factor \\\\\r\\alpha = SBPR_0 \\langle \\frac{1-h}{4h}\\rangle \u0026amp; rearrange \\\\\r\\end{array}\r\\]\nTo recap, \\(R_{eq}\\) and \\(SBPR_{eq}\\) are both varying with \\(F\\), but alpha and beta only change with \\(h\\) and \\(R0\\). \\(SBPR_{F=0}\\) is fixed based on the life history of your species.\n\r\rBonus Round: Stock Synthesis Recruitment Syntax\rEver wonder where the Beverton-Holt syntax in the Stock Synthesis manual comes from? It is simply the substitution \u0026amp; rearrangement of our derived values for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) into the original stock-recruit relationship. The “trick” (not really) is just leaving the equation for \\(\\alpha\\) in terms of virigin biomass and recruitment.\n\\[ \\begin{array}\r{rr}\rR_F = \\frac{SSB_F}{\\alpha + \\beta SSB_F} \\quad Bev-Holt\\\\\rR_F = \\frac{SSB_F}{\\frac{SSB_0}{R_0} \\langle \\frac{1-h}{4h}\\rangle + \\frac{5h-1}{4hR_0} SSB_F} \\quad substitute \\\\\rR_F = \\frac{SSB_F 4hR_0}{SSB_0(1-h)+ SSB_F(5h-1)} \\quad flip \\quad denom \\\\\r\\end{array} \\]\n\rYield and Surplus Production Curves\rWe are almost done. We have equations for equilibrium recruitment, and the definitions for the parameters of that equation. Note that equilibrium recruitment will change with \\(F\\) because \\(SPBR_F\\) changes, whereas alpha and beta will not (this is important later). We can now write down equations for our resultant equilibrium spawning biomass, and equilibrium yields: \\[ \\begin{array}\r{rr}\rSSB_{eq} = R_{eq} \\times {SBPR_F} \\\\\rYield_{eq} = R_{eq} \\times {YPR_F}\r\\end{array} \\] The “yield curve” is simply obtained by re-calculating these values across a range of Fs and plotting the results against input \\(F\\) and/or resultant \\(SSB\\). The height of the resultant dome is dependent on the value of \\(h\\) used, and the skewness in the biomass is related to selectivity. For the yield curve specifically, the peak occurs at the point just before natural mortality eclipses somatic growth, and the descending limb will be more “bendy” if you are selecting fish far before they mature. Another way of saying this is that the descending limb will accordingly change in height depending at the age of first capture.\r\r\r","date":1590019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590014187,"objectID":"42fd0cda07499f6da9e762b5fd75791e","permalink":"/post/recalg/some-rec-algebra/","publishdate":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/recalg/some-rec-algebra/","section":"post","summary":"I often find myself revisiting the various “re-arrangements” of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship, particularly when moving between equilibrium quantities.

Some folks take this to another level and effectively have a personal aesthetic (see what I did there) that they use across their work, which I find compelling. I am obviously not a graphic designer, but I love beautiful plots, and wanted to consolidate some of the best resources + starter tips for others here. These range from out-of-the-box default themes within the ggplot2 package itself, to those made by others, to resources you can use to make your own more (or less) from scratch.\n1 Straight up ggplot()\rThis is the ggplot2 default.

If you are like me, you need a pretty compelling reason to download someone’s random Github package purely for plotting needs – doubly so if the function of interest is buried within a massive package with a different purpose (I’m looking at you, oceanography). That said, here are some that I think are definitely worth adding to your toolkit.\n\r4 ggsidekick::theme_sleek() \rTo quote my friend/colleague, “Sean Anderson is the GOAT”. He has brought the law of subtraction to the max with this one, which is great for presentations and homework assignments. I only wish the axis and legend text were larger (but more on how one could fix that below).\nremotes::install_github(\u0026quot;seananderson/ggsidekick\u0026quot;) ## for later R versions library(ggsidekick) ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, fill = Species)) + geom_boxplot() + ggsidekick::theme_sleek()\r5 hrbrthemes::theme_modern_rc()\rInstalling this is a heavier lift due to the required fonts, but I really like the light/dark possibilities here and the emphasis on nice typefaces. Would recommend for presentations exclusively. The one issue I have is that the dark version does not automatically lighten the box borders, something I have tried to fix in my personal versions (see below).\n\r\r6 ggthemes\rThis is maintained by the ggplot2 folks and has lots of useful themes worth exploring. My favorite is solarized, which also has a light/dark option. I typically use the solarized-dark css from xaringanthemer for my slides, so popping in ggthemes::theme_solarized_2(light = FALSE) guarantees my figures will match nicely.\np1 \u0026lt;- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, fill = Species)) + geom_boxplot() + ggthemes::theme_solarized_2() p2 \u0026lt;- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, fill = Species)) + geom_boxplot() + ggthemes::theme_solarized_2(light = FALSE)\rlibrary(patchwork)\rp1/p2\rggthemes also has a theme called “solid” which is literally just a background and nothing else, a la sparklines, if you are…chic?\nattach(mtcars)\rggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = qsec)) +\rgeom_line(lwd = 1.1) +\rggthemes::theme_solid()\r\rGoing beyond: your own themes/packages\rI mentioned the issue of avoiding package-burden if you’re just interested in a nice plotting function. Relatedly, sometimes another person has already made a cool ggtheme that would be perfect, if only the font were bigger/colors brighter/legend placed differently. That leads me to the most involved, yet most rewarding approach, which is to write and save your own ggplot themes! I have compiled all my faves into a new package called kaplot, which includes the original theme_black and theme_mk() which I had placed on kaputils previously. Since kaputils is more of a simulation and data science toolkit (for me), I wanted a lighterweight pacakge with only my plotting stuff. The material ranges from mostly original to downright plagarized, and basically involves me tweaking pre-existing themes to be exactly as I’d like them. Going forward I will probably make themes in there specific to given publications.\nIf you aren’t ready to commit to a full package, I recommend editing a basic ggplot template (try theme_black() here ) and simply source()ing that script when you make your plots.\n\r7-9: My new plotting package, kaplot\rHere are some highlights.\nkaplot::theme_solarized_mk()\rMy tweak to ggthemes which ensures that legend key backgrounds are not white.

The whole goal is to reduce the number of lines I need to write for each figure.

I put out a call on twitter to sort out how this can be done! Stay tuned… \rTaste the rainbow\rAside from cbbPalette, I have several go-to color palettes from across the web which I regularly use.

Max Kuhn et al have extensive dox explaining how this very basic (i.e. fixed effects) framework can be re-framed into a mixed-effects or stan setup. The code below is effectively a tenth of what I did before, and automates the checking of many models specified via fit_with using or ignoring interactive terms. At the end I use purrr::map to calculate AIC on all at once, extract and plot outputs.

Before I disappear, I wanted to share how I went about studying for my exam, in hopes this can help other PhD students. Disclaimer: this is likely UW/SAFS specific, and the exam is a 5-day written format where each committee member gave me a set of readings and/or topics from which I was supposed to prepare to answer any long-format question they could give me in a single day.\n\rAcquire materials early. I actually got my readings over the summer, well before I knew exactly when I was taking the exam. This gave me a birds-eye view of the magnitude of the readings and helped me triage how much time I’d spend on each. For example, my advisor assigned two textbooks – I started reading these on the bus so when crunch-time came I was really reading them for the 2nd or 3rd time.\rMake a weekly gameplan. This is extremely valuable. I set my exam date about 2.5 months out, and drew up a timetable of what readings or topics I was to accomplish each week, with the final two weeks dedicated to review.\rHave a hardcore paper-organization system. If you can do this with printed sheets, I’m in awe. Otherwise, especially since I was required to synthesize and cite papers on the fly, I developed three digital tracking regimes for my readings. Three sounds like a lot, but I found using the following method enabled me to read each paper multiple times, extract the valuable information from it, and have pre-written summaries ready to go come exam day. The basic system was this:\rMendeley (any bib software should do): Load in all the readings, sorted into folders based on which committee member assigned it. This gives you a gestalt for the topics they’re leaning towards. Inside the software, I will read, highlight, and give brief annotations to the text itself. If there are equations or figures, I will paste a comment and summarize what is being said in my own words.\rExcel (see my How I keep up with the Literature post on my old blog). I continued my table-style tracking, but included a column for keywords that I thought may come up in the exam. For example, one comm. member gave me readings about catch-only methods, MSY, data-poor methods, and global fisheries; each of these became a keyword flag so I could sort the citations quickly depending on the question. Other columns included “claim”, “methods”, “major takeaways” and “larger scale conclusions”, where I connected that paper’s findings with others in that subsection.\rWord. This is where the magic happened. For each committee member, I would make up some generalized questions and try to answer them in a loose, outline style referring to my Excel sheet. I normally did this a day or two after my first Mendeley-Excel pass of the articles, which meant I got to do a second reading of the papers and ensured I understood them enough to comment intelligently. Good questions are things that would open a review paper or Op-Ed, not things like “What did Sekkar et al. say about X?”. Synthetic questions, such as “what have we learned about the influence of X on Y” or “Are Z considered good metrics of K?” are fruitful and will allow you to connect the readings.\r\rGo beyond. One of the best things I did during the exam prep was take a Coursera (free, online) course in Bayesian statistics. In add’n to the Bayes textbook I was assigned, the course let me get “tutored” in a condensed, low-pressure way AND the quizzes helped me test my knowledge. It wouldn’t have been realistic for me to take a formal Bayes class in the stats department this quarter (midterms and all). It’s easy to fool yourself that you “get it” after highlighting a textbook (for which the previous steps aren’t as applicable), but MOOCs like Coursera enable you to test yourself in real time.\rPace thyself. I read a quote last fall that said, “you can either contribute to the literature, or keep up with the literature”. Some days I would be deep in my Excel-Word mode for 9+ hours, and feel strangely like I hadn’t really “accomplished” anything, but this thought must be banished. Firstly, having a foundation in the literature of your field is something you’ll always need, and if you don’t do it now, you won’t have any more time when gainfully employed.\r\r","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577918187,"objectID":"9e3c965e0749cde5a6a38c1992c2af73","permalink":"/post/quals/how-studied-quals/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/quals/how-studied-quals/","section":"post","summary":"Yay, I got a high pass on my exam (now back to the things I neglected Autumn quarter).
